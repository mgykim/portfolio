                <br/>
                    <p>
                        Noticing little documentation for faculty and new IT hires, I 
                        created quick-reference guides that made classroom AV systems 
                        easier to use and reduced downtime during urgent situations. 
                        In addition, I supported clients directly at the help desk, 
                        ensuring clear communication, smooth issue resolution, and 
                        adherence to school security protocols.

                <h2>Problem</h2>
                <p>68% of faculty and students struggle to operate classroom technology, 
                    especially in older buildings with outdated equipment and limited 
                    budgets, leading to frequent user errors and damages.

                <h2>Research + Inspiration</h2>
                <h3>Affordance-based design</h3>
                <p>IKEA manuals–as a company designed around self-service, 
                    I analyzed what worked with their user manuals and how to 
                    incorporate similar design thinking into my own guides. I 
                    applied affordance-based design, such as using a finger symbol 
                    to indicate a tapping motion, to guide user interactiom.

        <!----------------------- DELIVERABLES ---------------------->

                <h2>Deliverables</h2>
                <h3>Fostering Team Identity</h3>
                <p>I also took it upon myself to make fun designs for our team during 
                    the freetime we had, our office was a little hard to find so I created 
                    a huge design for our team. Our team was very close, so creating a team 
                    logo for us was a way to boost morale and connection with one another, 
                    we even created our own team hoodies!

        <!----------------------- CONCLUSION ---------------------->
        <div class="middle-aligned">
            <h2>Impact</h2>
            <h3>Redesigned school-wide documentation and branding</h3>
                <p>Reduced tutorial-requesting help calls by 34%, completed 120+ 
                    tickets with CRM tools, inspired other departments to adopt a
                     similar documentation guide
                </p>
            <h3>Boosted team morale</h3>
                <p>I created custom merchandise and a welcoming client sign that strengthened 
                    our team’s identity and brought genuine joy to both coworkers and clients. 
                    Seeing their smiles reminded me of the emotional impact design can have—how
                     something visual can foster connection, pride, and positivity in a space.
