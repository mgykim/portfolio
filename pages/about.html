        <br/><br/><br/>
        
            <p>My name is Megan, and I am a human-focused product designer 
            based in NYC with a degree in Integrated Design & Media from NYU. 
            
            <br/><br/>
            I utilize UX design and motion graphics to create intuitive and visually 
            compelling digital experiences. With my experience in technical support, I empathized with 
            clients and sought design solutions that streamlined complex technological processes.
            
            Outside of my day job, I led branding, product design, and community
            engagement initiatives for large student organizations and freelancing. I directed operations and marketing 
            for 100+ engineering students, sold over 220 commissions,
            and was the UX designer for an award-winning AI chatbot. 
            <br/><br/>
                Throughout my diverse experience in AV, IT, and cars... my end goal is always the same: to simplify 
                complex systems and to create a positive and memorable experience for both the teams I work with and the clients we support.
